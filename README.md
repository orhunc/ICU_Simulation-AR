# Sound ICU Simulation

We measured emotions and cognitive performance via EKG and game metrics, while the user was put under increasing stress in a mobile, cross-platform, augmented reality, sound-only, ICU Simulation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the special strain health care workers are put under. We strive to further understanding and awareness of this problem and explore the emotional reaction, stress levels and performance of non-professionals to the isolated aspects ‘stress through environmental and occupational sound’ and ‘increasing exigencies’ of this line of work.
To that end, we employed A-Frame, Node.js and Resonance Audio web-frameworks and monitored the subject’s heart rate with a Polar Heart Rate Monitor belt during the simulation. Additionally, we used the mobile phone's inbuilt sensors to control the simulation.

Before the simulation started, the participant was introduced to the game with a tutorial that calmed down and prepared the participant for the scene. Once simulation has started, there was an increasing number of ”patient events” to manipulate participants’ stress levels in the course of the game. Each patient had accordingly different audio stimuli and an irregular treatment duration. The participants depended on the 3D spatial sounds to orient themselves in the scene and find the patient that needs a treatment. For monitoring the stress levels, the heart rate data from the Polar Belt was saved after each of these events.

The experiment was accompanied by surveys to verify our findings. Looking at the data from the surveys, it could be seen that the awareness of people regarding the stress levels of healthcare workers increased significantly. The magnifying amount of “patient events”  induced an increase in heart rate of participants, which is predominantly a sign of high stress levels.

Furthermore, we found out that participants could localise the 3D spatial sounds in the game with a high accuracy, which makes the use of such sounds highly suitable for AR/VR applications. 
We, as well, established that more visual input is needed in order to create a more realistic experience. However, our experiment shows that even when using mostly audio stimuli, high stress levels of the participants can be generated.
